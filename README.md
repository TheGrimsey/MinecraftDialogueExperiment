# Minecraft Dialogue Experiment

Experiment in making a dialogue system for a server with friends. Dialogues are loaded from ``data/dialogues`` check the test & test2 files in the repo for structure.

## This doesn't build.

Yeah, that's an issue with the version of AdditionalAttributes that Apoli depends on. I just grab the latest 1.18 jar from AdditionalAttributes' github releases and chuck it into gradle cache.

It works and I too lazy to solve it better.
